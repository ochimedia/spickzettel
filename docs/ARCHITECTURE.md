# Architecture

This document explains how Spickzettel is put together and, above all,
*why*: the decisions that are not obvious from the code, the constraints
that shaped them, and the approaches that were tried and rejected. Commit
messages say what changed; this is where the reasoning lives.

## Module layout and the platform boundary

```
src/
├── platform/   # The abstraction the rest of the app is written against:
│   │           # IPlatformHost, IOverlayWindow and plain data types.
│   └── win32/  # The Windows backend. The only place <windows.h> or
│               # <d3d11.h> is included.
├── core/       # Model, persistence, settings and the session. No OS
│               # headers, no Dear ImGui. Builds and tests on any platform.
├── ui/         # OverlayApp: the overlay as drawn with Dear ImGui. A view
│               # of the session.
├── app/        # TrayController: owns settings, session and overlay, and
│               # moves the window between hidden, edit and view-only.
└── app_main/   # The composition root: main_win32.cpp.
```

Three rules keep the layers apart, and the build enforces each:

- `core` links neither an OS SDK nor Dear ImGui. It is what any UI views,
  and a build that cannot reach `imgui.h` is what keeps it that way. The
  `linux-tests` preset builds and tests exactly this part with GCC or
  Clang, which is also what keeps a Linux port possible.
- Only `platform/win32` may include Windows headers. Everything above it
  talks to `IPlatformHost` and `IOverlayWindow`; a second backend
  implements the same two interfaces and nothing above changes.
- `ui` is the only library above the platform interface that links Dear
  ImGui. Dear ImGui itself is split the same way: `imgui_core` is the
  OS-independent part; the Win32 and D3D11 backend sources are compiled
  only into `sz_platform_win32`.

Words: the code says *item* for what the interface calls a *snippet*. The
two are the same thing; "snippet" is what a person sees, "Item" is the
struct.

## Build

Presets live in `CMakePresets.json`. `windows-msvc-release` is what a
release is built with; `windows-msvc-debug` additionally builds the UI
tests; `windows-msvc-demo` is the release build with a permanent demo
watermark compiled in; `linux-tests` builds the portable core and its
tests on a Linux host.

Every third-party dependency is fetched with `FetchContent` and pinned to
a tag or commit, so a checkout builds with nothing installed beyond a
compiler, CMake and Ninja. Header-only libraries are marked `SYSTEM` so
their warnings do not count against the project's own warning level.

### Cross-compiling: what is known

An earlier incarnation of this project cross-compiled the Windows build
from Linux with MinGW-w64 as a build-health check. The toolchain file is
not part of this repository, but three things learned then are worth
keeping for whoever adds it back:

- `imgui_impl_dx11.cpp` links `d3dcompiler` through
  `#pragma comment(lib, ...)`, which GCC ignores. The library has to be
  listed explicitly, which is harmless under MSVC.
- `_dupenv_s` and other MSVC "secure CRT" extensions are not reliably
  exported by the `msvcrt.dll` MinGW links against. Plain `std::getenv`
  works everywhere.
- A statically linked MinGW executable was flagged and deleted by Windows
  Defender as a virus. Real malware commonly static-links for the same
  "no DLLs to bring along" reason, and Defender's heuristics key on that
  shape. Copying the three MinGW runtime DLLs next to the executable
  avoids it; an MSVC build needs no such step.
